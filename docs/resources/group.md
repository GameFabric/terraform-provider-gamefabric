# gamefabric_group (Resource)

A Group is a collection of users that can be assigned permissions through role bindings. Groups simplify permission management by allowing you to assign roles to multiple users at once.

You can organize groups using labels and annotations, making it easier to manage access control in complex environments.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/editing-permissions#group">GameFabric documentation</a>.


## Example Usage

This example sets up a group with a single user.

```terraform
resource gamefabric_group "my_group" {
  name = "my-group"
  labels = {
    team = "backend"
  }
  annotations = {
    used-by = "ci"
  }
  users = [
    "gamedev@example.com"
  ]
}
```

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{ name }}"
  to = gamefabric_group.my_group

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_group.my_group "{{ name }}"
```
