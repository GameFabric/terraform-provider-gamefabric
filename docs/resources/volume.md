# gamefabric_volume (Resource)

A volume represents a storage resource that can be attached to vessels to provide persistent storage capabilities. Volumes are essential for gameservers that require data persistence across server restarts or deployments, such as saving player progress, game states.
This is currently a beta feature. Please contact your Customer Success Manager to discuss your use case and enable this feature.

## Example Usage
This example creates a volume and mounts it into a vessel on the path `/data` within the gameserver container.

```terraform
data "gamefabric_volumestore" "eu" {
  name = "storage-eu"
}

data "gamefabric_environment" "prod" {
  name = "prod"
}

data "gamefabric_branch" "prod" {
  display_name = "prod"
}

data "gamefabric_image" "gameserver" {
  branch = data.gamefabric_branch.prod.name
  image  = "gameserver"
  tag    = "1.2.3"
}

data "gamefabric_region" "europe" {
  name        = "europe"
  environment = data.gamefabric_environment.prod.name
}

# Setup a volume to be used by a vessel
resource "gamefabric_volume" "example" {
  name         = "example-volume"
  environment  = data.gamefabric_environment.prod.name
  volume_store = data.gamefabric_volumestore.eu.name

  capacity = "100M"
}

resource "gamefabric_vessel" "this" {
  name        = "my-vessel"
  environment = data.gamefabric_environment.prod.name

  region = data.gamefabric_region.europe.name

  containers = [
    {
      name      = "default" # the gameserver container should always be named "default"
      image_ref = data.gamefabric_image.gameserver.image_ref
      volume_mounts = [
        {
          name       = gamefabric_volume.example.name
          mount_path = "/data"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  volumes = [
    {
      name = gamefabric_volume.example.name
      persistent = {
        volume_name = gamefabric_volume.example.name
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
