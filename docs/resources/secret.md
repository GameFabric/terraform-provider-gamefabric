# gamefabric_secret (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1: Secret with persistent data (will be stored in state)
resource "gamefabric_secret" "db_credentials" {
  name        = "examplesecret"
  environment = data.gamefabric_environment.dev.name
  description = "Backend database credentials"
  labels = {
    game       = "my_first_game"
    component  = "database"
  }
  data = {
    db_user     = "dbuser123"
    db_password = "abcdef123456!#$&'*+-=?^_`{|}~"
  }
}

# Example 2: Secret with write-only data (will NOT be stored in state)
resource "gamefabric_secret" "api_key" {
  name        = "examplesecret"
  environment = data.gamefabric_environment.prod.name
  description = "API key for external service"
  labels = {
    game       = "my_second_game"
    component  = "api"
  }
  data_wo = {
    api_key    = "sk-1234567890abcdef"

## Schema

### Required

- `environment` (String) The name of the environment the resource belongs to.
- `name` (String) The unique object name within its scope. Must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or dots. Must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Maximum length is 63 characters.

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured map of keys and values stored on an object.
- `data` (Map of String, Sensitive) Data contains the secret key-value pairs. These are stored in state and persisted. Use data_wo for write-only ephemeral values.
- `data_wo` (Map of String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) DataWO is a write-only version of data. Values are sensitive and write-only - they are only transmitted to the server and never displayed or stored in state.
- `description` (String) Description is the optional description of the secret.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique Terraform identifier.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{ environment }}/{{ name }}"
  to = gamefabric_secret.this
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_secret.this "{{ environment }}/{{ name }}"
```
