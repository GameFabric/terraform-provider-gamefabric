# gamefabric_authentication_provider (Resource)

An Authentication Provider configures external identity providers for user authentication in GameFabric. Currently, only OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers are supported, allowing you to integrate with identity providers like Google Identity Platform, Microsoft ENTRA, Amazon Cognito, Okta, Auth0, or any other OIDC-compliant service.

The authentication provider configuration includes:
- **OIDC Settings**: Client credentials, issuer URL, and redirect URI
- **Scopes**: The OAuth2/OIDC scopes to request (e.g., openid, profile, email, groups)
- **User Mapping**: Keys to extract user ID and username from claims
- **Claim Mapping**: Options to map non-standard claims to GameFabric's standardized claims
- **Claim Modification**: Advanced features to filter and transform group claims
- **Security Options**: Certificate validation, email verification, and other security settings
- **Provider Discovery Override**: Custom URLs for authorization, token, and JWKS endpoints when the provider returns non-standard discovery responses

**Important**: The `client_secret` is stored as a sensitive value in your Terraform state. Consider using secure state storage and secret management practices.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/setup-third-party-oauth">GameFabric documentation</a>.


## Example Usage

This example configures an OIDC authentication provider with claim mapping and group filtering.

```terraform
resource "gamefabric_authentication_provider" "company_oidc" {
  name         = "company-oidc-provider"
  display_name = "Company OIDC Authentication"

  oidc = {
    issuer        = "https://auth.company.example.com"
    client_id     = "gamefabric-client-id"
    client_secret = "your-client-secret-here"
    redirect_uri  = "https://gamefabric.company.example.com/callback"

    scopes = [
      "openid",
      "profile",
      "email",
      "groups"
    ]

    user_id_key   = "sub"
    user_name_key = "preferred_username"

    insecure_enable_groups       = true
    insecure_skip_email_verified = false
    get_user_info                = true

    allowed_groups = [
      "gamefabric-admins",
      "gamefabric-developers"
    ]

    claim_mapping = {
      email              = "email"
      groups             = "groups"
      preferred_username = "preferred_username"
    }

    claim_modification = {
      filter_group_claims = {
        groups_filter = "^gamefabric-.*"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `oidc` (Attributes) OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider configuration for the authentication provider. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--oidc))

### Optional

- `display_name` (String) The user-friendly name of the provider.
- `name` (String) The unique object name within its scope. Must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or dots. Must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Maximum length is 63 characters.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique Terraform identifier.

<a id="nestedatt--oidc"></a>
### Nested Schema for `oidc`

Required:

- `client_id` (String) ClientID is the client ID of the OIDC provider.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) ClientSecret is the client secret of the OIDC provider.
- `issuer` (String) Issuer is the issuer URL of the OIDC provider.
- `redirect_uri` (String) RedirectURI is the redirect URI of the OIDC provider.

Optional:

- `acr_values` (List of String) ACRValues (Authentication Context Class Reference Values) that specifies the Authentication Context Class Values within the Authentication Request that the Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference.
- `allowed_groups` (List of String) AllowedGroups is a list of groups that are allowed to authenticate with this provider.
- `basic_auth_unsupported` (Boolean) Basic auth unsupported causes client_secret to be passed as POST parameters instead of basic auth. This is specifically "NOT RECOMMENDED" by the OAuth2 RFC, but some providers require it.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1
- `claim_mapping` (Attributes) Claim mapping contains the claim mapping options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--oidc--claim_mapping))
- `claim_modification` (Attributes) Claim modification contains all claim mutations options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--oidc--claim_modification))
- `get_user_info` (Boolean) GetUserInfo uses the userinfo endpoint to get additional claims for the token. This is especially useful where upstreams return "thin" id tokens.
- `hosted_domains` (List of String) HostedDomains was an optional list of whitelisted domains when using the OIDC provider with Google. Only users from a whitelisted domain were allowed to log in. Support for this option was removed from the OIDC provider. Consider switching to the Google provider which supports this option.
- `insecure_enable_groups` (Boolean) InsecureEnableGroups enables groups claims.
- `insecure_skip_email_verified` (Boolean) Insecure skip email verified overrides the value of email_verified to true in the returned claims.
- `insecure_skip_verify` (Boolean) Insecure skip verify disabled certificate verification. Use with caution.
- `override_claim_mapping` (Boolean) OverrideClaimMapping will be used to override the options defined in claimMappings. i.e. if there are 'email' and `preferred_email` claims available, by default Dex will always use the `email` claim independent of the ClaimMapping.EmailKey. This setting allows you to override the default behavior of Dex and enforce the mappings defined in `claimMapping`.
- `prompt_type` (String) Prompt type will be used for the prompt parameter. When offline_access scope is used this defaults to prompt=consent.
- `provider_discovery_override` (Attributes) OIDC provider discovery overrides contains the options to override the discovered urls. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--oidc--provider_discovery_override))
- `root_ca_certificates` (List of String) Root CAs are root certificates for SSL validation.
- `scopes` (List of String) Scopes are the scopes requested from the OIDC provider. Defaults to "profile" and "email".
- `user_id_key` (String) User ID Key is the key used to identify the user in the claims.
- `user_name_key` (String) User Name Key is the key used to identify the username in the claims.

<a id="nestedatt--oidc--claim_mapping"></a>
### Nested Schema for `oidc.claim_mapping`

Optional:

<a id="nestedatt--oidc--claim_modification"></a>
### Nested Schema for `oidc.claim_modification`

- `filter_group_claims` (Attributes) Filter group claims is a regex filter used to keep only the matching groups. This is useful when the groups list is too large to fit within an HTTP header. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--oidc--claim_modification--filter_group_claims))
- `new_group_from_claims` (Attributes List) New group from claims specifies how claims can be joined to create groups. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--oidc--claim_modification--new_group_from_claims))

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{ name }}"
  to = gamefabric_authentication_provider.company_oidc
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_authentication_provider.company_oidc "{{ name }}"
```
