  name         = "prod"
  display_name = "Production"

  labels = {
    environment_type = "production"
    criticality      = "high"
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) DisplayName is the name of the environment shown in GameFabric.
- `name` (String) The unique environment object name. The name must be between 1 and 4 characters long and match the pattern `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured map of keys and values stored on an object.
- `description` (String) Description is the description of the environment.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique Terraform identifier.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{name}}"
  to = gamefabric_environment.dev
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_environment.dev "{{ name }}"
```
