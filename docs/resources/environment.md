# gamefabric_environment (Resource)

Environments are a mechanism for isolating groups of resources. Resource names must be unique within each environment, but not across environments. They can therefore be used to separate production, staging, testing, and any other environments and ensure that they don't interfere. Alongside the RBAC features, it also allows limiting the access to certain environments from users.

Capacity is managed on a per Environment basis via Regions.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary#environment">GameFabric documentation</a>.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a production environment with minimal labels
resource "gamefabric_environment" "prod" {
  name         = "prod"
  display_name = "Production"
  description  = "Production environment for live game servers"

  labels = {
    environment_type = "production"
    criticality      = "high"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) DisplayName is the name of the environment shown in GameFabric.
- `name` (String) The unique environment object name. The name must be between 1 and 4 characters long and match the pattern `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations is an unstructured map of keys and values stored on an object.
- `description` (String) Description is the description of the environment.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique Terraform identifier.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{name}}"
  to = gamefabric_environment.dev
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_environment.dev "{{ name }}"
```
