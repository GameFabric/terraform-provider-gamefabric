# gamefabric_role (Resource)

A Role defines a set of permissions that can be assigned to users, groups, or service accounts through role bindings. Roles use rule-based access control to specify which actions (verbs) can be performed on which resources within specific API groups and environments. For certain resources, access can be further limited to specific scopes (e.g., branches) via `scopes` or to specific resources (e.g., armadas) via `resource_names`.

Please see the response of the discovery endpoint at `https://<your_tenant_name>.gamefabric.dev/api` of your GameFabric installation to see which `api_groups` and `resources` are available.

You can organize roles using labels and annotations for better management.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/editing-permissions#role">GameFabric documentation</a>.


## Example Usage

This example creates a role with multiple rules granting access to various resources in a specific environment and to some system-wide resources.

```terraform
resource "gamefabric_role" "developer_role" {
  name = "developer-role"

  labels = {
    team = "backend"
    env  = "development"
  }

  annotations = {
    description = "Role for developers with limited read and write access"
  }

  rules = [
    {
      api_groups     = ["armada"]
      environments   = ["dev"]
      resources      = ["armadas", "armadagameserverstates", "armadarevisions", "armadarevisionstatuses", "armadasets", "armadasetrevisions"],
      verbs          = ["get"]
      resource_names = ["development-armada"]
    },
    {
      api_groups   = ["core"]
      environments = ["dev"]
      resources    = ["regions"]
      verbs        = ["get", "post"]
    },
    {
      api_groups   = ["core"]
      environments = ["*"]
      resources    = ["sites", "locations"]
      verbs        = ["get"]
    },
    {
      api_groups   = ["container"]
      environments = ["*"]
      resources    = ["images"]
      verbs        = ["get"]
      scopes       = ["dev-branch"]
    },
    {
      api_groups   = ["observability"]
      environments = ["*"]
      resources    = ["monitoring"]
      verbs        = ["get", "post"]
    },
    {
      api_groups   = ["audit"]
      environments = ["*"]
      resources    = ["logs"]
      verbs        = ["get"]
    },
    {
      api_groups   = ["core"]
      environments = ["*"]
      resources    = ["sites/gameservers"]
      verbs        = ["delete"]
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The unique name of the role.
- `rules` (Attributes List) List of rules that will be applied to the role. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) A map of annotations to assign to the role.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of labels to assign to the role.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique ID of the role.

<a id="nestedatt--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Required:

- `api_groups` (List of String) List of API groups that the rule applies to. Use `*` to match all API groups or choose any from: `armada`, `authentication`, `billing`, `container`, `core`, `formation`, `protection`, `rbac` and `storage`.
- `environments` (List of String) List of environments that the rule applies to. Use `*` to match all environments.
- `resources` (List of String) List of resource types that the rule applies to. Use '*' to match all resources, use the plural for specific resources, e.g. `armadas`, use the slash for sub-resources, e.g. `images/status`.
- `verbs` (List of String) List of actions that can be performed on the resources. Use `*` to match all verbs.

Optional:

- `resource_names` (List of String) List of specific resource names that the rule applies to. If specified, the rule only applies to resources with these names.
- `scopes` (List of String) List of scopes to restrict the rule to. Optional field to further limit the permissions.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{ name }}"
  to = gamefabric_role.developer_role
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_role.developer_role "{{ name }}"
```
