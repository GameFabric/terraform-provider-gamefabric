# gamefabric_protection_gatewaypolicy (Resource)

Gateway Policies allow you route traffic of your game servers through gateways for specified destination CIDRs.
For example if your game server relies on specific cloud services their endpoints can be accessed through the gateways instead of directly from the node hosting the game server.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/multiplayer-services/server-protection/gateway-policies">GameFabric documentation</a>.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create a gateway policy with a set of CIDRs.
resource "gamefabric_protection_gatewaypolicy" "game_backend" {
  name         = "game-backend"
  display_name = "Game Backend"
  description  = "The game backend that game servers connect to"
  destination_cidrs = [
    # Azure Service
    "4.232.24.16/30",
    # Google Cloud Service
    "23.236.48.0/20",
    # Single IP
    "23.236.48.231/32",
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `destination_cidrs` (List of String) The CIDRs that should use the gateway for outbound traffic, rather than the game server node.
- `display_name` (String) The user-friendly name of the gateway policy.
- `name` (String) The unique object name within its scope. Must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or dots. Must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Maximum length is 63 characters.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) A map of keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects.
- `description` (String) Description is the optional description of the gateway policy.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique Terraform identifier.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{name}}"
  to = gamefabric_protection_gatewaypolicy.game_backend
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_protection_gatewaypolicy.game_backend "{{ name }}"
```
