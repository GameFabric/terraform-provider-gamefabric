## Schema

### Required

- `destination_cidrs` (List of String) The CIDRs that should use the gateway for outbound traffic, rather than the game server node.
- `display_name` (String) DisplayName is friendly name of the gateway policy.
- `name` (String) The unique object name within its scope.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description is the description of the gateway policy.
- `labels` (Map of String) A map of keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize objects.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique Terraform identifier.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  id = "{{ name }}"
  to = gamefabric_protection_gatewaypolicy.game_backend
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import gamefabric_protection_gatewaypolicy.gamebackend "{{ name }}"
```
