# gamefabric_locations (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get all locations without filtering.
data "gamefabric_locations" "all" {
}
# output: .names = ["frankfurt-gcp", "amsterdam-gcp"] # this is a list of locations that match the criteria

# Filter locations by provider type.
data "gamefabric_locations" "cloud" {
  type = "cloud"
}

# Filter locations by geographic attributes.
# You can filter by continent, country, or city.
data "gamefabric_locations" "europe" {
  continent = "europe"
}

# Combine multiple filters.
# This example gets all baremetal locations in Europe.
data "gamefabric_locations" "eu_baremetal" {
  type      = "baremetal"
  continent = "europe"
}

# Filter by city for specific location granularity.
data "gamefabric_locations" "frankfurt" {
  city = "frankfurt"
}

# Filter by country to get all locations in a specific country.
data "gamefabric_locations" "germany" {
  country = "germany"
}

# Use regular expression to filter location names.
# This is useful for pattern matching location names.
# For example, to get all GCP locations:
data "gamefabric_locations" "gcp" {
  name_regex = ".*-gcp-.*"
}

# Combine regex with other filters.
# Get all AWS locations in North America.
data "gamefabric_locations" "na_aws" {
  continent  = "north-america"
  name_regex = ".*-aws-.*"
}
```
