# gamefabric_image (Data Source)



Configuring an image is identical on all resources which support specifying a container image like armadas, armadasets, vessels or formations.

## Example Usage - Specific Image Tag

Setting up an armada using a specific image tag from the GameFabric container registry.
Only if you change the specified tag in the gamefabric_image data source the armada will be updated to use the new image tag.

```terraform
data "gamefabric_image" "gameserver" {
  branch = data.gamefabric_branch.example.name
  image  = "gameserver"
  tag    = "0.4.0"
}

resource "gamefabric_armada" "this" {
  name        = "myarmada"
  environment = data.gamefabric_environment.prod.name

  region = data.gamefabric_region.europe.name
  replicas = [
    # ...
  ]
  containers = [
    {
      name  = "default"
      image = data.gamefabric_image.gameserver.image_target
    }
  ]
}
```


## Example Usage - Latest Image Tag

Setting up an armada using the latest image tag from the GameFabric container registry for the specified image.
Whenever a new image tag is pushed to the specified image, the armada will be updated to use the new image tag when you run terraform apply.
However if you want to automatically update the image without running terraform apply you should use the `gamefabric_imageupdater` resource in addition.

```terraform
data "gamefabric_image" "gameserver" {
  branch = data.gamefabric_branch.example.name
  image  = "gameserver"
  tag    = "latest"
}

resource "gamefabric_armada" "this" {
  name        = "myarmada"
  environment = data.gamefabric_environment.prod.name

  region = data.gamefabric_region.europe.name
  replicas = [
    # ...
  ]
  containers = [
    {
      name  = "default"
      image = data.gamefabric_image.gameserver.image_target
    }
  ]
}
```
