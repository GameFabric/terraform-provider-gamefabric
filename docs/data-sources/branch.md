# gamefabric_branch (Data Source)

GameFabric runs its own internal Container registry proxy, which is where you should push your game server images to in order to have them available in game servers.
Those images are scoped by branch. For example, a standard use case would be to have a development branch and a production branch.
The development branch would contain dev images to be used by a development Armada,
while the production branch would only contain releases of the game server that make it to production.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary#branch">GameFabric documentation</a>.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get a branch by its unique name.
#
# The name must match exactly and is case-sensitive.
data "gamefabric_branch" "main" {
  name = "main"
}
# output:
#   {
#     name = "main"
#     retention_policy_rules = [
#       {
#         name        = "default"
#         keep_count  = 10
#         keep_days   = 30
#         image_regex = ".*" # this is a regex to match the image name, it should be used to match the image name
#         tag_regex   = ".*" # this is a regex to match the tag, it should be used to match the tag
#       }
#     ]
#   }

# Get a branch by display name.
#
# Display names are user-friendly names that can contain spaces and special characters.
#
# Note:
# - Only one of 'name' or 'display_name' should be specified.
# - If multiple branches share the same display name, an error will occur.
data "gamefabric_branch" "production" {
  display_name = "Production Branch"
}
```
