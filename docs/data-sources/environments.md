data "gamefabric_environments" "non_prod" {
  label_filter = {
    environment_type = "non-prod"
  }
}
# output = array of environment objects

# Get environments with multiple label filters.
data "gamefabric_environments" "dev_stage" {
  label_filter = {
    environment_type = "non-prod"
    stage            = "dev"
