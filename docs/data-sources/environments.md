# gamefabric_environments (Data Source)

Environments are a mechanism for isolating groups of resources. Resource names must be unique within each environment, but not across environments. They can therefore be used to separate production, staging, testing, and any other environments and ensure that they don't interfere. Alongside the RBAC features, it also allows limiting the access to certain environments from users.

Capacity is managed on a per Environment basis via Regions.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary#environment">GameFabric documentation</a>.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get all environments without any filtering.
data "gamefabric_environments" "all" {
}

# Get environments filtered by labels.
#
# Labels are key-value pairs used to organize and categorize environments.
#
# Note:
# - Only environments that have ALL specified labels with exact matching values are returned.
data "gamefabric_environments" "non_prod" {
  label_filter = {
    environment_type = "non-prod"
  }
}
# output = array of environment objects

# Get environments with multiple label filters.
data "gamefabric_environments" "dev_stage" {
  label_filter = {
    environment_type = "non-prod"
    stage            = "dev"
  }
}
```
