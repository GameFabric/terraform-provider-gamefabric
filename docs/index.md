# Terraform provider for GameFabric

GameFabric provider is used to interact, provision and manage your GameFabric resources.

## Example Usage

A typical provider configuration looks like this and requires setting up a service account in GameFabric with appropriate permissions.

It is strongly advised to provide the password using the `GAMEFABRIC_PASSWORD` environment variable for security reasons.

```terraform
provider "gamefabric" {
  customer_id     = "<your customer id>"
  service_account = "ExampleServiceAccount@ec.nitrado.systems"
}
```
