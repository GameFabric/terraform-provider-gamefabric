# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

A Service Account is a non-human identity used for programmatic access to GameFabric resources. Service accounts are typically used by automated processes, CI/CD pipelines, or applications that need to interact with the GameFabric API.

Each service account is automatically assigned an email address based on its name and can be granted permissions through role bindings, similar to regular user accounts. A password is automatically generated when the service account is created. This password can be accessed via the sensitive `password` attribute. You can organize service accounts using labels for better management. A service account can't be changed after creation, so changes to the resource will trigger Terraform to recreate (delete and add) the service account, which will also generate a new password.

**Important**: Please be aware that Terraform stores the `password` in the Terraform state (see <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data">Manage sensitive data in your configuration | Terraform documentation</a>). Consider storing your Terraform state in a secure location as well as writing the password into a secret manager if it needs to be accessed by other systems.

For details check the <a href="https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/authentication#managing-service-accounts">GameFabric documentation</a>.


## Example Usage

This example creates a service account with labels for organization.

{{ tffile "examples/resources/gamefabric_service_account/single.tf" }}


{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
{{- if or .HasImport .HasImportIDConfig .HasImportIdentityConfig }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
{{- end }}

{{- if .HasImportIDConfig }}

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

{{tffile .ImportIDConfigFile }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .HasImport }}

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

{{codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}
{{- end }}
