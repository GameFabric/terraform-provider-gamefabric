# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

A Secret resource in GameFabric allows you to securely store sensitive data (credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) that can be referenced and used across your infrastructure. Secrets are scoped to environments and provide a centralized way to manage sensitive information that can be shared across multiple deployments.

## What is a Secret?

Secrets are key-value data objects that store sensitive configuration information. They can be:

- **Mounted as files** in the filesystem of containers in your Armadas, ArmadaSets, Vessels, and Formations.
- **Referenced in environment variables** across all resources that support environment variable sources.
- **Organized with labels** to enable filtering and discovery of related secrets.

## Storage Options: `data` vs `data_wo`

GameFabric Secrets support two different storage modes depending on your security requirements:

### Regular Data (`data` attribute)
Use the `data` attribute when you need to:
- Store secret values persistently in Terraform state
- Keep secret values visible in your state file (your state should be secured)
- Manage secret values that don't change frequently

The `data` attribute values are stored in the Terraform state file and marked as sensitive, so they won't appear in logs or console output.

### Write-Only Data (`data_wo` attribute)
Use the `data_wo` attribute when you need to:
- Pass temporary secret values during resource creation or updates
- Avoid storing sensitive values in Terraform state
- Keep secrets ephemeral and only used during operations
- Maximize security by not persisting values

Values in `data_wo` are write-only: they're transmitted to the server but never stored in state or displayed in plans. This is the recommended approach for highly sensitive credentials like API keys or temporary tokens.

**Note:** Only one of `data` or `data_wo` can be specified for a secret resource. Choose based on your security requirements.

## Notes on Import

This resource **does not support import** because the GameFabric API returns masked secret data (not the actual values) when reading secrets. Since Terraform cannot determine the actual secret values from the API response, importing would result in incomplete state.

To manage secrets, create them as new resources in your Terraform configuration with the appropriate `data` or `data_wo` values.
