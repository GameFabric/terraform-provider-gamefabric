# Terraform provider for {{ .RenderedProviderName }}

{{ .Description }}

## Example Usage

A typical provider configuration looks like this and requires setting up a service account in GameFabric with appropriate permissions.
See [GameFabric Documentation](https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/authentication#managing-service-accounts) for more details on creating service accounts and [managing permissions](https://docs.gamefabric.com/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/editing-permissions).

It is strongly advised to provide the password using the `GAMEFABRIC_PASSWORD` environment variable for security reasons.

- `GAMEFABRIC_HOST`: The GameFabric API host for example: `example.gamefabric.dev`.
